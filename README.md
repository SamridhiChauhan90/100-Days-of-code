# 100 Days of Code Challenge - C Language

This repository documents my journey to code every day for 100 days using the C programming language. The goal is to strengthen my understanding and skills in C through daily practice.

## What I plan to do
- Learn and practice C basics like data types, operators, loops, and functions
- Work on small projects and exercises in C
- Solve coding problems and challenges using C
- Explore important C concepts like pointers, memory management, and file handling

## How to follow my progress
Each day will have a folder or file with code and explanations for that day's challenge. You can check the folders named `Day-1`, `Day-2`, and so on.

## Why I am doing this
To build strong foundational skills in C programming and improve my coding consistency.

## Technologies I will use
- C programming language
- GCC compiler or equivalent
- Git and GitHub for version control

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss C programming or collaborate!
